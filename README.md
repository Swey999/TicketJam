## Project Overview

TicketJam enables efficient management of ticket availability and sales across multiple event sections. The application enforces sales rules such as date-based ticket availability, inventory restrictions, and preventing multiple customers from purchasing the last available ticket.

## Features

- **Ticket Management**: Create, update, and manage tickets with start and end date-based availability and section assignments.
- **Order Processing**: Place orders with multiple tickets from different sections, validated for inventory availability and date range.
- **Inventory Control**: Enforce inventory limits to prevent overselling and maintain minimum stock levels.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Prevent duplicate purchases of the last available ticket.
- **Database Integration**: Supports SQL Server for order and ticket data persistence.

## Installation

To get started with TicketJam on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ticketjam.git
    ```

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**:

    - Launch Visual Studio and go to `File > Open > Project/Solution`.
    - Select the `TicketJam.sln` file.

5. **Initialize the database (if using Entity Framework)**:

    - Open **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio and run:

        ```bash
        Update-Database
        ```

6. **Run the application**:

    - Press `F5` or go to **Debug > Start Debugging**.

## Usage

1. **Create and Manage Tickets**: Admin users can add tickets with start and end dates and assign them to specific event sections.
2. **Place Orders**: Users can select tickets from multiple sections. TicketJam validates ticket availability and inventory before completing the order.
3. **Inventory Management**: The system enforces minimum inventory levels and blocks simultaneous purchases of the last available ticket by multiple users.

## Testing

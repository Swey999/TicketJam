It ensures tickets are sold only within set date ranges, prevents overselling, and supports concurrent ticket requests.

Features
Ticket Management: Create and manage tickets with availability dates and section assignments.
Order Processing: Place orders with multiple tickets from different sections, validated for inventory and date availability.
Inventory Control: Enforce inventory limits to prevent overselling and maintain minimum stock levels.
Concurrency Handling: Prevent duplicate purchases of the last available ticket.
Database Integration: Persist orders and retrieve ticket data via database integration (e.g., SQL Server).
